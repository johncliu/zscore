# ZSCORE
Understanding the Statistical Significance of your Inference Data

## Challenge
A major difficulty that most data science and machine learning engineering teams face is in understanding the statistical significance of their model performance at inference time. ZSCORE allows users to upload their inference datasets and automatically calculate and report statistical significance results relevant to the datasets.

## Architecture
We use Google Cloud Functions to serve our backend analysis engine, and Google Cloud Run to host our Vue-based frontend.
